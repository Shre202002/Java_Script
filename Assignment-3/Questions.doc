if else

=> Write a JavaScript program to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers
=> Write a JavaScript program to sum the multiples of 3 and 5 under 1000.
=> Write a JavaScript program which compute, the average marks of the following students Then, this average is used to determine the corresponding grade.

Student Name	Marks
David	             80
Vinoth	       77
Divya	             88
Ishitha	       95
Thomas	       68
The grades are computed as follows :

Range	Grade
<60	F
<70	D
<80	C
<90	B
<100	A

=>  Write a JavaScript program which iterates the integers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
=> Write a JavaScript program to find the armstrong numbers of 3 digits. Go to the editor
      Note : An Armstrong number of three digits is an integer such that the sum of the cubes of its digits is equal to the number itself. For example, 371 is an Armstrong number since 3*3 + 73 + 1*3 = 371.
